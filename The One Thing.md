The Six Lies between You and Your Success  
Lie 1: Everything Matters Equally

Jub hamari life me koi most important aur urgent work aata hai.  Too hum suddenly bina kuch soche, Samjhe bahut actively usse complete karne lagte hai. Pur aise karne par hum actually me hamari goal ke pass nahi pahanch pate aur usse door chale jate hai. 
Achiever hamesa clear hote hai apni priority per. Aur unko pate hai konsi cheez pehele karna hai aur kun si badme. 

 
Humare pass to-do list too hota hai but author kahate hai todo list ke sath sath hamare pass aak success-list hona bahut jaruri. Jo hame hamari goal pe focused rakha ne ke sath sath extraordinary result achieve karne me madut karre gaa. 
Agar hum dhayn se dekhangee too hamare pass bahut hi kum cheez hote hai jo hame bahut jyada matter karta hai baki doose less important cheez se. Jisse hame dhayn me rakhna chahiyee. 
Kisi ne sahi kaha hai….
Doing the most important thing is 
Always the most important thing ever.
Lie 2: Multitasking 
We must understand and agree that, multitasking is a big lie in our todays 
Hame ya samaj na hoga ki multitasking ak bahut badi jhut hai. Ye fast moving world me jub hum do cheez ak sath karna chahate hai vo kabhi bhi achese nahi ho payagaa. Ya me nahi scientifically ye prove ho chukka hai ki agar hum multitasking kare hai to hum ak bhi kam ko sahi tarike se nahi kar payangee. 
Researcher bolte hai ki multitasking karne se hum hamari work efficiency se 28% less efficient hojate hai. Jo hame hamari goal me focused nahi rakhpata hai. Foucs bahut jaruri hai koi bhi goal aur dream ko achieve kar ne ke liya.
For example agar hum ak paper ko heavy sunlight ke pass rakhte hai to vo sirf garam hoga pur jalega nahi. But agar hum ussi sunlight k oak power glass ke madut se focused karde to vo paper pal bhar me hi jal jayegaa. So multitasking karna bund kare aur apni puri focus sirf ak cheez ko complete kare. 
Lie 3: A Disciplined Life

Aksar hame sun  ne ko milta hai ki agar app discipline raho ge to ap ko success milega. Actually me ye true hai but reality me agar app thodi kum decipline me bhi success ko achieve kar sakte hai. Author kehate hai…
success is about doing the right thing, 
not about doing everything right.
Ye success pane ke liya trick hai ki. Ak right habit ko kare aur thodi si discipline ko follow kare jub tak vo task complete nahi ho jata. Ak average habit banana ke liya only 66 days lagta hai . Obviously ye habit banana easy nahi hoga but muskil bhi nahi hai so agar koi muskil aye to uska samna kare aur jaldi give up na kare.  
Lie 4: Willpower Is Always on Call
Hame sunne ko milta hai ki, mere pass unlimited will power hai. Jo ki ak jhut ke siva aur kuch nahi. Willpower ak battery ki tarah hai hum jitna usse use karenge vo utna khatam hota jayagaa aur usse recharge ki jarurat padagaa. So author kahate hai hame hamari most important vo ONE Thing .. early morning khatam karna jaruri hai. Hamari will power khatam hone se pahe le. 
Lie 5: A Balanced Life
Author karate hai ak balanced life ak bahut badi jhut hai. Hum ak din 24 hour me sari cheezo ko cover nahi karsakte. Hamesa kuch na kuch choot jata hai.  Hum Jitna bhi kosis kar le hamesa kuch nad kuch undone ho ke rahajata hai ussi day, week, month, year ya phir life may. Jo hama re liya sabse jaruri hai usse complete kare aur ye sam jhe ki atatime hum subkuch complete nahi kar sakte aur usse accept kare. Ye hamesa yaad rekhe ki hum job koi important priority ke upper kam karte hai to hum automatically out of balance ho jate hai, iss vajaise distract na hoke isss reality ko accept kare. 

Lie 6: Big Is Bad
 “I was truly beginning to think that the secret to success was to get as tightly wound up as possible each morning, set myself on fire, and then open the door and fly through the day, unwinding on the world, until I literally burnt out. And what did all of this get me? It got me success, and it got me sick. Eventually, it got me sick of success.”
We overthink, over plan, and over-analyze our careers, our businesses, and our lives; that long hours are neither virtuous nor healthy; and that we usually succeed in spite of most of what we do, not because of it. We can’t manage time. The key to success isn’t in all the things we do but in the handful of things we do well.
If you can honestly say, “This is where I’m meant to be right now, doing exactly what I’m doing,” then all the amazing possibilities for your life become possible.
Abhitak hum jane ki hamari success me kya kya rukabat aata hai. Ab hum janenge kai se usse compeet  kare. 


THE PATH TO PRODUCTIVITY

Aap ko yee Focusing Question apne aap se hamesha puch na hai ki : “What’s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”

Have purpose and priorities

In relation to long-term goals, Keller explains that once the goal is set, you need to break it down into individual actionable steps that you can be auctioning right away.

 
Productivity
By now, Keller has made it pretty clear that productivity is the driving force behind your successes. Keller explains that using your calendar to block off time dedicated to your ONE thing is the key to making sure you get the work done. Make sure you physically block of the hours you want to dedicate to your ONE thing. And do it every single day, you want this to become an established habit.
”Everything else—other projects, paperwork, e-mail, calls, correspondence, meetings, and all the other stuff— must wait.”
 
Make three commitments
Keller believes that there are 3 key commitments you need to make when time blocking with the purpose of reaching your goals:


1.	Adopt the mastery mindset. By committing to mastery, you are aiming to be your absolute best at whatever you choose to focus on. By being your best you’ll achieve the best results.
2.	Continually be learning the better way to do something. Just because you’ve been doing something for awhile and it’s working doesn’t mean it’s the only or best way to be doing it. Always be learning.
3.	Hold yourself accountable. You are responsible for your ONE thing and only you. Make sure you do everything you possibly can to reach this goal.
